# Engineering Lead **@ Protomated**: Assessment

This assessment is designed to evaluate your practical skills and problem-solving abilities specific to the Engineering Lead position. I value your time, so it's designed to be completed within 3 days, though you're welcome to submit it sooner if you finish early.

**Your assessment is to implement a simplified document connector and API service:**

**Requirements:**

1. Create a Python FastAPI application that:
    - Implements a RESTful API for document management
    - Connects to a mock document system (simulate document management API)
    - Processes documents for AI context (text extraction and chunking)
    - Stores document metadata in PostgreSQL
    - Implements vector embeddings storage (you can mock this or use a simple in-memory solution)
    - Includes proper authentication middleware
    - Implements comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Includes unit tests for key components
2. **Database Design:**
    - Design appropriate PostgreSQL schemas for documents, users, and metadata
    - Include migration scripts or SQL schema files
3. **Documentation:**
    - API documentation (FastAPI's automatic docs are fine)
    - README with setup instructions
    - Brief explanation of your architectural decisions
    - Security considerations and potential improvements

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Code quality and Python best practices
- API design and error handling
- Database schema design
- Security considerations
- Testing approach
- Documentation clarity
